### Problem Statement
Develop and application that can better help users understand and be aware of their unconscious biases
### Solution
I developed an interactive chatbot (personify) which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to help users uncover their biases. Through text and sentiment analysis, the chatbot is able to disect user's response and point out stereoptypical perceptions held within their descriptions. It also provides tangible steps for the user to take in mitigating their bias.
